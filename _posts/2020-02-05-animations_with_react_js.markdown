I've just researched animations for one of my applications and it's actually easier than I'd imagined (https://reactjs.org/docs/animation.html). I’ve realized that things are better to understand with experience...and yes ‘duh!’ right? Before I had no idea how I was going to do anything and now I can I visually plan you what I want to do and know how to prepare for execution.

I’m going to create a title page component that transitions into the home page. I’m not sure about the transition duration, but I will test it at a 3 second period and see if it isn’t awkward.
Maybe transitions into the next pages might be positive as well, I’ll do some research on how to make this look good. I feel like this steps into the web developer field (just a bit, lol), but not too far out of my software engineer training. Seeing the solutions I program and being presented in an appealing way is something I take pride in.

Sometimes you just have to do it by yourself!
