I am currently in the process of adding styles to the front-end web app I have been tasked with...and I’m enjoying every minute. I’ve just received the fonts and image files and I’ve added them to an asset folder in the src folder of my React app. I was advised(which made sense) to add these to the src folder versus the public folder because my components will need direct access to them in order to render. I’ve received the mock up designs of each slide and they look amazing, I can’t wait to have them up and running.

I’ve already drafted some ideas on how I want things to flow. I really want to add animation to spice it up(as I mentioned in my previous post). First things first, having everything render properly should be my main priority because without that, none of the animations will make sense. I’ve searched the React docs(who has slowly become my best friend) and found this https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/, for those who are interested. This shows how to correctly import images and fonts.

More all nighters will be in store for me, and I can't wait. As soon as I’m able to show this project I will show the world. Stay tuned!
