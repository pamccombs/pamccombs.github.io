I will honestly say that initially I thought that code was boring. It was something that wasn't for me. My friend was a Computer Science major in school and I was like "good luck". It wasn't until I actually looked at what code was and more importantly what I could do that I began to realize why it was such an important thing for me to learn.

Programming and its infinite language wisdom, makes it possible to build anything from the ground up, which is something very attractive to me. I could make something that the world would need and depend on. That is something like a dream turned to reality. Programming is also not so simple that anyone can do. This creates a challenge and I am quite competitive, to many of my friends loathing. 

To be great at something I put my all into, above all and everyone else, is  very exciting for me. I am thrilled to see what comes next in ,my story of Programming.
