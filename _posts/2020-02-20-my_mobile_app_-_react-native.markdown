Along with importing source data from a Graphic Designer for my clients Better Offer Letter application, I’ve decided to create a mobile application as my personal project. I’ve been drafting and outlining the details on this as I’ve been getting familiar with React-Native docs.Taking a bit back, before I even chose React-Native I needed to choose for which phone OS I wanted to create the app for.

Primarily my thought was to create the app for the Android and then convert the code into iOS format after It was done...terrible idea. That process can take extremely long, can be cost heavy, and is inefficient in the long run. I then decided to take my talents from native programming to cross-platform programming. Cross-platform programming in short, allows you to design one code that both operating systems can use and also offers the option for OS-specific programming.

I am nose-deep in the React-Native docs(https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), as this framework is one of the top ways to build a mobile app and I’m already comfortable with React.js with my web app. I believe this will be a great transition.


Mobile App!!! That is all.
