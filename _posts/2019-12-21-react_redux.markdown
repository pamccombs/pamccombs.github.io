The whole process took awhile to set up, but I feel as if this JS library is simple to use once you get the hang of it.  In order to figure things out, I needed to understand exactly what React's purpose is. I pretty much had the exact same capabilities when using vanilla JavaScript so why did I need this? So i attempted to create the same things with and without React and reailized that it was simply an easier task using React. A process that could take hours with vanilla JavaScript in some cases can take minutes with React. With this understanding, it was easier for me to work with React because I know it's purpose.

Understanding when to use state and props is deifinitely a must and was relatively easy to pick up. Learning how to incorporate Redux was another story. There seem to be so many moving parts to Redux that made me feel that its creation seemed almost nonsensical. So many extra steps to accomplish  a global state made me extremely sad. I still feel very sad that this had to be done, but I am glad for the experience. Learning new things is always a positive for me.

Abstract thinking is always critical when it comes to programming so if you have this down, its a breeze.
