Wow...it was everything I expected, difficult. I fortunately was given unlimited time so there was no pressure there. The key factor to finish was determination. There were 3 parts and I started on the ‘medium’ difficult portion. I’m unsure if I can go into details but the first part involved RegEx.  I essentially had to filter a string that was to be interpreted as a password. There were about 7 things that had to be considered in order to complete that part of the assessment. 

There were also two more parts. One was labeled ‘hard’ and the other was ‘easy’. I figured I would jump right into the “sadness”. And decided to go right into the ‘hard’ labeled assessment. It was react, something I feel well versed in.  However, the task was definitely difficult. This one involved creating a game. And it took well over 5 hours to complete. It was very exciting. I feel like I learned a lot of new skills and concepts during the process. 

Finally, I decided to walk on “easy street” and complete the ‘easy’ part of the assessment. This one involved a MySQL query. This is where I needed to create a table and filter three conditions. I have nothing left for you, because I finished in 5 minutes, (lol)! 

All together, this was a very exciting experience. One that I would like to do again but only if I absolutely had to. Happy coding!
