So...this simple thing called "Starting Your Career"  has turned into a beast. Employers require work experience for an entry-level job. Take a moment to let that set in. However, updating your resume and learning new skills can literally be the difference between getting the job and being declined for an interview.

I decided to take on small projects while I wait for a job offer in order to gain a bit of experience. I was told that this looks more attractive to a potential employer (I’ll give an update once I know for sure), one of them being ‘betterofferletter.com’. Due to client confidentiality I can’t fully disclose the details, however I am building this with React.js.

Along with the required technical skills of a job posting, brushing up on people skills wouldn’t hurt. Especially one who isn’t very social (like myself), this allowed me to feel comfortable and confident in my interviews.

These are just some tidbits of knowledge I came across. If they can help anyone else that’s great.

Good Luck!
