The overall experience I have with betterofferletter.com is great. I’m able to add it to my resume and it allows me to be able to put my skills into action. Specifically, it improves my customer or supervisory relationships due to my ability to complete tasks. The client requests changes and I make them happen, one of the many things that will be required during your entire career.

This work experience has also allowed me to understand the importance of reusable code. Creating initial and reusable functionality in one part of the app makes it easier to move forward. I can simply look at the logic I’ve already created and readapt it for my new problem, making it simpler to solve. I definitely believe it would be a good idea to look back at old projects even and reuse and improve your code, specifically if your current problem requires a similar or the same algorithm.

So...is work experience for an entry level job overrated? I’d say yes and no. Depending on the position and what is expected. For me, I’ll be doing all I can to learn as much as I can.
