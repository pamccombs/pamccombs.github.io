Last weekend I participated in a game jam via itch.io. Basically for x amount of time you are supposed to create a game from scratch. You can do it alone or assemble a team to tackle the tasks needed to complete it. I chose the latter as it was my first time. I was apprehensive at first because the task seemed daunting. 

I mean c’mon, just graduating school and you think you can create a game? Did I mention that it was in C#, a language that I not only was completely unfamiliar with, but also one that I wanted to avoid at all costs?

We used discord as a means of communication and navigating git pull conflicts, because no one wants those. We ended up choosing a 48 hr jam and it was intense. The theme was ‘bounty’ meaning that we had to design the game with this idea being central to the purpose of the game. 

It was tough, navigating a new language and being stuck to the C# docs pretty much the entire time because I had no idea what I was doing. I was a bit down on myself but I then realized that this is all apart of the process when learning something new. My team supported me through it and we managed to get the job done, in impressive fashion I would say. 

The link is https://bd3n.itch.io/the-guild if you would like to check it out. For the amount of time we had, I’m proud of the product.
