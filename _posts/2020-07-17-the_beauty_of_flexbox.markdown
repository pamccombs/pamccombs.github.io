I've had an idea of what flexbox can do, but it was a bit difficult to understand. Sometimes reading docs as the sole source of information just isn’t enough. A colleague of mine suggested CSS-Tricks (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). I was hesitant at first, but it was definitely a well-documented read (and with pretty pictures). Flexbox essentially eliminates tedious positioning with CSS and gives you options to automatically display the elements on the page. 

What was important to me was that the application I’m building has conditional rendering in some of the slides. Since flexbox is automatic, the settings that I placed on it allowed for the conditional render to be displayed in a predetermined way. I didn’t have to manually add CSS positioning for it and that is AMAZING. I would give some examples of this but unfortunately, I’m still learning. I’ll make sure to add some examples in my next post. 

For now, happy coding!!!
