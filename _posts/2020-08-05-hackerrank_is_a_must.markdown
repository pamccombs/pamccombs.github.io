Completing the HackerRank, or other practice coding challenges is a must do. I have mostly been working on apps that require a lot of styling and had lost touch with algorithms. That was not advised. I know, I know, I shouldnâ€™t have admitted to this but if my honesty can help anyone else then I have done my job. I received a lot of coding challenges and felt confident because of my daily coding and was thoroughly mistaken. It was rough. 

When working through HackerRank algorithm challenges start with the easy difficulty, even if you are experienced. This is to get the hang of how HackerRank wants you to display your output and for you to understand what input values they are providing and where they are coming from. I have had so many instances where I forget a comma or omit a return keyword and get a completely wrong result. Doing these challenges have made me more aware of what I am doing while I am coding instead of correcting after receiving that famous syntax error.

I am also posting my HackerRank solutions on my GitHub in a pinned repo if anyone is interested in looking at my solutions. (https://github.com/pamccombs)

Again, Happy Coding!!!
