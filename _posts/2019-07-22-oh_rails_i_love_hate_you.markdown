How I enjoy your magic and constant error codes! Well I'm both annoyed and appreciative with creating an application in Rails. It is indeed magic and with the more readable error codes in Rails I'm able to pinpoint the problem more acurately. The project went very well, I feel very confident in what I've learned. The process was easiest when I went to a similar, popular website (ign.com) and essentially broke it apart, created my own flow of how my app should be used, and rebuilt it as my project. Seems like cheating but why reinvent the wheel when you can make it better? 

I would recommend using a popular website as a starting point for anyone. It allowed me to get right into what makes my app different.
