I’ve been working with inline styles and CSS in React and some would stay to stick with one...but I enjoy using both.

Now I am no expert so please don’t allow my opinion to be anyone’s ‘be-all and end-all’ but I believe that either option is more convenient based on what you are placing in either. For example, I need a different color for each of my pages so inline background color for each page component made sense to me. All of my <h1> tags however did not need to be so dynamic so it made more sense to use CSS for all my <h1> tags.

So my personal hybrid approach is that anything of a relatively static styling option, use CSS, otherwise inline styling might be a better option.

I will reveal my web app soon once everything is ready and I can give better visuals of how things are working. 

Until next time. Happy Coding!
