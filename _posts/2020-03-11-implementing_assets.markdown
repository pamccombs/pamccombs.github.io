Figuring out how to implement and where to place assets.

Through research there doesn’t seem to be an exact consensus on where to place things. Some say in src, some say to create a folder in root. I decided to place them in the src folder. I feel it to be great practice to organize everything into specific folders so everything is easy to find.

I now begin the journey of placing them. This shouldn’t be too difficult as it would mostly involve CSS manipulation to find ideal spots. I am using a created mock up on where to place things so that’s positive. This allows me to only worry about the code and less about the creativity.

Hopefully this segment can help, if even a bit! Happy coding!
