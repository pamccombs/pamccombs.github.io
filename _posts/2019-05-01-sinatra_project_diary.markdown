I've just begun the project. I've created a template for it using past lessons and labs. I'm trying to hone in on exactly what type of app I would like to make that also would meet the requirements. I spoke with my girlfriend and she has taken the liberty of choosing what this app does due to my indecisiveness. "Something interesting like an aquarium" she says...still not sure but I'll probably choose what she picks and make it a challenge.

I've finally decided to go with the lipstick idea she has given me. I began to run through my spec.md check list and accomplish each task carefully. I'm encountering many sintax errors but I'm still working through them.

I completed the working draft of the project and I then decided to do some styling to the project.

The project is done and now i've decided it's good enough to submit. I am currently working on the video recording and will be submitting it shortly. On to Rails!!!
