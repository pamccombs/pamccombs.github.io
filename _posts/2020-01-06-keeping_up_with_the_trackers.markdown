I'm a recent graduate and I can finally call myself a Software Engineer...well kind of. Starting my first job will solidify this feeling of achievement for me. Following this job search tracker tool provided by Flatiorn will put me in a better place to do so. I am currently overwhelmed by all of the things I need to do in order to keep up every week, however I like the fact that it keeps me focused on the main task at hand...starting my career.

The GitHub commit requirement forces me into a place where coding needs to be done. This honestly was going to happen regardless because looking through my old projects and seeing the potential they have to be great makes me want to expand on them. However if you aren't like me and want to just create something altogether new, this requirement is a great push in that direction. It keeps everything you have studied fresh and it's much easier to recall as you continue to code.

This makes talking to contacts for jobs, interviews, and code challenges a lot easier to handle because the next thing better than getting prepared is being prepared.
