The walkthrough that Avi provided game me a great confidence in starting and finishing a draft of this project. I felt like you needed to know everything exactly in order to make a functioning code. I realized that as long as you have a general idea of what you want your program to look like, you can navigate through the whole thing with research. I felt like starting was a pain until I created a list then started writing the "code I wish I had". I then substituted everything I wish I had with what I needed lol. I thought it was pretty cool seeing myself slowly turn into the type of software engineer I would like to be.
