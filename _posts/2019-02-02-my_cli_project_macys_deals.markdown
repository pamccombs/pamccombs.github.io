The walkthrough that Avi provided game me a great confidence in starting and finishing a draft of this project. I felt like you needed to know everything exactly in order to make a functioning code. I realized that as long as you have a general idea of what you want your program to look like, you can navigate through the whole thing with research. I felt like starting was a pain until I created a list then started writing the "code I wish I had". I then substituted everything I wish I had with what I needed lol. 

Dealing with the scraping section of this was a bit tiring but I managed to create some really solid, simple code. The edge cases were also "interesting" but some critical thinking allowed me to get by them. I ended up being really proud of my code and I'm thankful for the experience.(As cliche as that might sound.) I thought it was pretty cool seeing myself slowly turn into the type of software engineer I would like to be.
