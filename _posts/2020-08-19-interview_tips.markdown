I recently finished an interview for a big company. The process consisted of 2 interviews that were a mix of cultural and 
technical. In case you might have an upcoming similar interview, I would like to help you prep.

First off, HackerRank or a similar challenge site will be your best friend. Each challenge puts you in a scenario where you will need to think differently to achieve the desired output. That practice will help you when you need to do whiteboard coding for your interviewer.

Secondly, be yourself. The interviewer wants to see who you are naturally. If you are not a fit for the company while you are being naturally who you are then they do not deserve you. If you try to be someone you are not, it will be glaringly noticeable and may hinder your chances of selection.

For the challenge portion, be sure to think aloud and ask as many questions as possible until you understand what needs to be done. I would say you ask thoroughly about what the task is, the desired input and output, and any constraints to consider. 

Good Luck and Happy Coding!!!
