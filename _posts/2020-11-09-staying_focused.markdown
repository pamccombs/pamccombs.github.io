Although this is something less technical, I believe it is relevant to new programmers of all types. Staying relevant and up to date with current technologies, even if you are yet to be employed as a programmer is important. Dabbling in personal projects and open source contributions are some of the ways to stay ready and be in the spirit of learning better ways to code. Learning new improved functionalities of the language you are coding in and applying new or different algorithms to your code is also important. This has been a great way to move forward through the current epidemic and the competitive nature of the job search in this field. 

Also, the topic that is less commonly spoken about, imposter syndrome, can be a burden while navigating the job search scene. Through applying the methods I have identified previously, I have been able to avoid the effects of this. We are in trying times as of late with many distractions along the way, while also fighting imposter syndrome. This can be problematic, I understand. I am here to say, keep pushing and keep improving. The more you learn and the more you do only improve your stock and builds your confidence as a great programmer. You belong!

Happy coding everyone!
