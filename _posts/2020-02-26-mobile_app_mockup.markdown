I’m currently working on a mock-up for the app. I’m customizing how many screens I want to have for navigation and navigation options in general. I had to do some research on the navigation with...you guessed it...docs! (https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/) I actually added a small contribution to these docs as I was going through it. The details are pretty straight forward for those who want to venture in the mobile app world.

My concept is a secret for now, but I’ll give the organizational details. I will have users, that means I’ll need a login, which means I will need password encryption. I’m going to use an API to connect this data and handle the authentication params. Users will need to read their data as well as post so I will need to create fetch requests for these respectively, along with proper places to view this data. I’m going for functionality before appearance so...it’s going to look very unappealing for now!

I’d rather have a working app than one that looks good and buggy! I will have both however in due time! 

Time to head back into the docs!
