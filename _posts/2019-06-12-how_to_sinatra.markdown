Going through Sinatra i would say the best way to look at it is how it was advertised by Learn, wait until you see Rails. Learning Sinatra allows for one to truely understand why Rails is ultimately a better coding experience. Learning how this is so makes sense because it allowed me to fully understand what was happining in Rails, specifically in routes. Being forced to write every single route helped me understand where everything goes and why it is necessary and even why something isn't necessary.
