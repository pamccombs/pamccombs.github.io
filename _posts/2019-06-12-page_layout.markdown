I would say one of my major confusions with page layout are linking the sources. When starting something new I've noticed that the more you see, the more that you dont understand, and the more you want to run away! Breaking down every part of the html that creates the layout might seem a bit painful. It will definitely take some time, however once you know it, you know it...sort of like riding a bike I guess. When I look at it now, all of the many potential wrappers etc., I tend to look where they need to start and end and when I create my own it seems a lot less cumbersome.
